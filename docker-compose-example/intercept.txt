To setup the docker container to intercept traffic, you will need to use the 
host network for the container (network_mode: host). This also means you can
only run one instance of such container.

The container also need to be privileged. (NET_ADMIN) 

Set the TUNNEL_MODE to "auto".

For DNS intercepts, set the local IP to be the first resolver.

Here is a example docker-compose.yaml file

--
services:
  autonomous-er:
    container_name: netfoundry-er
    image: netfoundry/autonomous-router:v1.3
    # or image: netfoundry/netfoundry-router:latest
    pull_policy: always
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    environment:
      - VERBOSE=1
      - REG_KEY=<registration_key from console>
      - TUNNEL_MODE=auto
    volumes:
      - ./ziti_router:/etc/netfoundry

For Ubuntu 24.04 OS, here are the steps to fix the DNS resolver.
Create a file "/usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/01-netfoundry.conf"
$ sudo mkdir /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d
$ sudo cat > /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/01-netfoundry.conf
#Netfoundry Added file
[Resolve]
DNS=<local IP address, can be retrieved with "ip a" command>

Then restart the "systemd-resolved" services
$ systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service

Use "resolvectl" to make sure the local address is the first one on the resolver.
$ resolvectl
Global
         Protocols: -LLMNR -mDNS -DNSOverTLS DNSSEC=no/unsupported
  resolv.conf mode: stub
Current DNS Server: 10.0.135.223
       DNS Servers: 10.0.135.223
